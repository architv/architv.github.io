Recently, I came across [John T. Meyer's post](http://bit.ly/my4words). The post talked about choosing four word every year representing the themes and areas of focus for that year. <!--more-->

I found it to be great activity to undertake. So inspired by the post, I decided to write down four words for this year that would represent the qualities I want to focus on/inculcate in. The idea is to put them somewhere where it stays in front of my sight most of the time.

My four words for this year are:

1. Patience
2. Authentic
3. Persevere
4. Yes

##Their meaning

1. __Patience__ - I like to pursue ambitious goals(don't we all?). Be it getting fit or working on that one challenging idea, they all take time. Having patience is very necessary in such cases.

2. __Authentic__ - I borrowed this one from John's post. Authenticity is a rare quality. It's hard to find people who can speak their mind in front of you. So, this year instead of pleasing others I'll be authentic. I'll speak my mind.

3. __Persevere__ - This is most common quality among all the successful people. If you pick up the biography of any successful person, they all persevered. They never gave up. They believed in their vision when every one else laughed them off. 

4. __Yes__ - In the past, I have said no to many opportunities that came my way. Reason - I was afraid to try out the new, I was scared what the outcome was going to be. In short, I was afraid to change anything. So, this year I have decided that I am going to say yes more often. Instead of resisting change I'll put my arms around it and say, "Yee Haw, take me for a ride!" and I'll see where it takes me. 
(Not to be confused with saying yes to people).


I hope these words inspire me and help me grow in the year ahead.
