The good thing about hackathons is that whether you win them or not, they are awesome. But if you win them, they become all the more awesome. This is exactly what happened when I recently participated in Policy Hack.

Policy Hack was an open data hackathon, organised by Evidence for Policy Design, a Harvard University based research center, hosted at the awesome place of American Center, New Delhi.

I was a member of a team of some awesome developers. [Laavanye](https://twitter.com/LaavanyeBahl) hacked on Android and was the driving force for the team, [Yogesh](https://twitter.com/yogesh_Balan) and Naman are some of the best Android UI developers I've met. I call them UI gods. I managed the server and the web frontend for our app.

We hacked under the Education Track of the Central Square Foundation where we were given shit loads of data and we had to present it in a way that it was beneficial for the students, their parents and the government. 

We made an app that presented data of various schools and districts on a map which made it much more interpratable. Also, we added a SMS and IVRS based system to give out information to people who don't have access to sophisticated technology.

The atmosphere was amazing. Food were in plenty.

We hacked under the Education Track of the Central Square Foundation where we were given shit loads of data and we had to present it in a way that it was beneficial for the students, their parents and the government. 

We made an app that presented data of various schools and districts on a map in a much more interpretable way. Also, we designed a SMS and IVRS based solution to give out information to people who don't have access to sophisticated technology.

The atmosphere was amazing. Snacks were in plenty.
