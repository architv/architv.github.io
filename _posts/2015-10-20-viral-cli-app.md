Sunday Evening, I am working on my laptop while Barclays Premier League commentary is playing in the background. I am trying to do two things simultaneously but I am able to do none.<!--more--> 

Since the work has to be done urgently, I switch off the TV. But now, I am constantly switching between my terminal and browser to check the scores, after all it's Manchester United who is playing.

This has happened to me dozens of time and every time I wish I didn't have to leave my terminal to check the scores. As a developer, my job is to find the solution. It was then the idea of soccer cli came to me.

### A month and dozens of pull requests later:

It's been more than a month since I "launched" soccer cli and it got:

- close to 250 stars on github
- number 1 trending python repo on Github
- over 25k downloads on PyPi
- many more happy and productive football fans

It even made it's way to [Pycoders weekly newsletter](http://pycoders.com/)

It was on Vietnam's hackernews too!

The plan was not to create the next trending repo (even if it were, it would have been fine). it was to solve a problem that I myself was experiencing

## How?

There were three basic things which were used to create soccer-cli:

__Football API__

The first task was to get the football scores. After a bit of looking for it, I stumbled across Joe Kampschmidt's [awesome curation](http://www.jokecamp.com/blog/guide-to-football-and-soccer-data-and-apis/#openfooty) of all the source for getting data. 

Since, I had no intention to pay for the API, I looked for the free ones. I tried both [openfooty API](http://www.footytube.com/openfooty/) and [football-data API](http://api.football-data.org/index). Openfooty API had a stale community and it was hard to get an API key. football-data API on the other hand, had a good documentation, easy to get an API key and scores were updated fast enough to match my needs. So, I went ahead with it.

__Live Scores__

While the football-data API updated the scores fast enough, it still didn't implement real-time scores. So, to fix this problem I decided to create [my own API](http://soccer-cli.appspot.com/) to get live scores. It's a simple with just a single endpoint which fetches the scores from [ESPN](http://www.espnfc.com/scores) and spits it out in the json format

__Click__

Since the tool was entirely command line, I needed an easy way to get and parse command line arguments. [click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) came to my rescue. From it's documentation:

> Click is a Python package for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way with as little code as necessary. It‚Äôs the ‚ÄúCommand Line Interface Creation Kit‚Äù. It‚Äôs highly configurable but comes with sensible defaults out of the box.
> It aims to make the process of writing command line tools quick and fun while also preventing any frustration caused by the inability to implement an intended CLI API.

## End

Doing all this has been fun. I have learnt a lot more about python through various pull requests. Open source is awesome, you get to learn new concepts and apply them. 

The rewards are amazing, seeing people love what I made and talk about it, makes me extremely happy and proud.
