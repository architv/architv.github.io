Yo writing some random shit.

In Wikipedia and other MediaWiki projects, Special:Random can be used to access a random article in the main namespace; this feature is useful as a general starting point for browsing Wikipedia or if you just want to learn a random piece of information.

Depending on your browser, it's also possible to load a random page using a keyboard shortcut (in Firefox and Chrome Alt-Shift+X).

To create a link to a random page in a different namespace, use [[Special:Random/Namespace]].

For example, Special:Random/Talk will take you to a random article's talk page.
